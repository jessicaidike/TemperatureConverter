Reflection (6 sentences)

I followed TDD by first defining failing JUnit tests for each conversion method before adding the implementation. 
This approach clarified expected results and helped me validate correctness quickly. 
Maven managed JUnit 5 automatically and ran tests through the surefire plugin, keeping setup simple. 
I made small, frequent commits to Git to track progress for each step (tests first, then code, then refactor). 
Running the full test suite after each change ensured no regressions. 
Overall, this strengthened my confidence with TDD, Maven, and writing clean, testable Java methods.
